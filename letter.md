My dear little Florian,

I really enjoyed speaking with you today, it lightened up my day, my week even.
I loved hearing the stories and the effort you put into my games, I really felt like my work was appreciated by you.
Even though you are making bots to play for you, you still need to put time and effort into them.
It made me understand that they really bring value and fun in some way to people, and I hope we can continue doing that together, and beat Art'kadia. 

Best regards, 
with love,
Psders.
